GNU General Public License v3.0

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
this GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or requesting you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) Avert, in short, that the terms of this License will not be broken.
(2) Make available without further cost an assurance against future lawsuits by anyone who might receive the code under such agreement (copyleft).

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL states explicitly
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals, including those in the mobile device sector. Therefore,
we have designed this version of the GPL to forbid this practice for
those products. If such methods are used by a party, then all products
received under that party are also subject to this License and cannot be used against the user without permission by such source.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict modification and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to make it clear that the free software covered by this License is not
made harmless to patent holders.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you liable for copyright infringement under
applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables
other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may propagate and
modify the work, and that the licensee and the recipient may convey
the work under these terms, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list would suffice.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for that Major
Component. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the executable work. For a work based on HTML,
CSS, XML, or other human-readable languages, the "Corresponding
Source" includes image files (animated GIFs for your cool stuff here, right?) and JavaScript used to
implement functionality in the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in a source code form is that
same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly confirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output,
constituting a covered work, is also subject to this License.
This License acknowledges your personal right to use this work for the purpose of demonstrating your skills, including the use on GitHub profiles, where the output (like a generated cool README.md) is covered by this License, and is made possible for the purpose of demonstrating your skills. This includes the right to generate and display dynamic visual assets that showcase your technological prowess.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of technological
measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License, and you disclaim
any intention to limit operation or modification of the work.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy of a work that you
convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is modified
   from the Program and giving the date of modification.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
   under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
   requirement modifies the "Appropriate Legal Notices" requirement in
   section 0.

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
   anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
   apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the
   whole of the work.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
   "Appropriate Legal Notices"; however, if the Program has interactive
   interfaces that do not display "Appropriate Legal Notices", your
   work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in
or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"Aggregate". This License does not apply to the other works in an
aggregate if they are not themselves covered by this License.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the Corresponding
Source in a machine-readable format under the terms of this License, in
a medium customarily used for information interchange.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the executable work. For a work based on HTML,
CSS, XML, or other human-readable languages, the "Corresponding
Source" includes image files (animated GIFs for your cool stuff here, right?) and JavaScript used to
implement functionality in the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in a source code form is that
same work.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement this License by
making exception to one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program are treated as if
they were included in this License's body, in the section 0
definitions. If additional permissions apply only to part of the
Program, that part may be used under those permissions alone, provided
the Program as a whole remains subject to this License.

You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a
covered work, for which you have or can assert copyright.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as differing from the original version; or

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names or other identifying marks of authors or licensors of the material; or

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or a modified version of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient for the work.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any covered work, contains such a further restriction, you may remove that restriction.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation of your
violation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the work without
(or with an acknowledgement of) notice of its previous violation and
termination of your rights, does not grant you the right to
propagate or modify it.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered
work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, propagate and
modify that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner permitted
by this License, provided that such infringement would be in
conjunction with the Program. For the purpose of this definition,
"control" includes the right to grant sublicenses of patent rights in
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

A "contributor version" is the version of the Program released by a
contributor, or a work based on that version, that includes the work
of the contributor.

This License grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
otherwise run, modify and propagate the contributor's essential patent
claims, for any purpose, if that patent license would be infringed by
the contributor's contributor version, or any part thereof. The patent
license applies to all contributor versions, including those that are
part of an Aggregate, unless it is impossible for the contributor to
grant such patent license.

If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that a contributor version (or a
work based on it) infringes any patent, then any patent license that
contributor granted to you under this License for that contributor
version terminates as of the date such litigation is filed.

Some programs distributed under the GNU General Public License are
provided with additional patent licenses from the copyright holder.
May not contain any claims to enforce patents as an exclusive right in this work.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If you are to rely on the GNU General Public License for your programs,
you must not restrict, in any way, the rights of others who receive
copies from you.

For example, you may not require a license fee for any modifications
that you make, nor any royalties for distributing copies of the work.

This is a problem for free software. Any developer who works to
make a covered work into proprietary software, or any other kind
of work that is not free as defined in this License, is a threat to
all users of the work. If such restrictions are made, they can and
should be removed.

13. No Surrender of Users' Legal Rights.

No covered work shall have the property of being part of an effective
technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations
under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
technological measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License, and you disclaim
any intention to limit operation or modification of the work.

14. Limitation of Liability.

There is no warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by
applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright
holders and/or other parties provide the Program "as is" without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and
performance of the Program is with you. Should the Program prove
defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or
correction.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN
ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
PROGRAM.

16. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                            APPENDIX: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full license is
located.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you.

If the program has interactive user interfaces, make them display "Appropriate
Legal Notices".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply GNU GPL terms to
non-software documents, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>.
